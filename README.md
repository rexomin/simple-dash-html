# Front-Template
Welcome to the project template for front-end development! This template is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing pages and components for websites. It provides a structured approach to building and organizing your front-end projects.

## Components
To create components, simply add separate PHP files under the "components" folder. These files will be automatically imported and accessible through the `/components.php` file. You don't have to worry about any additional configuration or setup.

## Pages
To create pages, add separate PHP files under the "pages" folder. The template includes "header.php" and "footer.php" files, which are automatically displayed on every page. You can access your pages using the following URL structure: `/index.php/page`.

### Folder Structure:
- components: This is where you can create and store your components.
- core: This folder contains the core files of the template. You generally don't need to make any changes here.
- pages: This is where you create and manage your individual pages.
- public: Use this folder to store any public resources such as images.
- scripts: Write your JavaScript code in this folder.
- styles: This folder is meant for organizing your CSS styles.

Feel free to customize and build upon this template according to your project requirements. Happy coding!
